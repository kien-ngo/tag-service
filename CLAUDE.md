- This is a basic web api server using Hono and Bun runtime. So use Bun instead of Node whenever possible.
- The database schema is declared inside `./src/db-schema.ts`.
- The endpoints are listed inside `./src/endpoints`
- We use Scalar for the API playground. For each endpoint that requires Scalar, declare an `<endpoint-name>.scalar.ts` file. For example, `health.ts` is the endpoint, `health.scalar.ts` is the file that exports the Scalar interface for the health endpoint.
- After all changes are done, run `bun lint:fix` to lint the code using Biome
- Following Biome conventions: Use `Number.isNaN` over `isNaN`, `Number.parseInt` over `parseInt` etc.
- Use `zod` for runtime validation
- The port that is running the web server can be checked inside .env file, SERVER_PORT
